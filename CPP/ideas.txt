DONE 9) Address Book
If you need to get a quick project into your resume that not only looks good but helps boost your fundamentals of data structures, 
then this is the way to go. All you need to do is implement the functionality to add, update, or delete data from the address book. 
The project will require some knowledge of data structures as well as how to manipulate and work with them.

If stuff seems a bit too easy, connect the project to a database in the background for storing details there. Connecting and updating 
the database with every operation performed on the frontend will be a challenge for a beginner.
