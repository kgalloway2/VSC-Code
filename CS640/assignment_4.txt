Assignment 4
In this assignment you will design and train a backpropagation network to learn the exclusive-OR function.  
Try using the same learning rate in all cases.

1.   Use one hidden layer with 4 hidden units, binary representation and binary sigmoid. Plot the error as a function of the number of iterations.
2.   Repeat (1) using bipolar sigmoid and bipolar representation for exclusive-OR function.
3.   Repeat using two hidden layers (3 units in the first hidden layer and 2 units in the second hidden layer) and bipolar representation.

Neural Networks:

(Done) A: 1 hidden layer, 4 hidden units, binary representation (0,1) and binary sigmoid activation function
(Done) B: 1 hidden layer, 4 hidden units, bipolar representation (-1,1) and bipolar sigmoid activation function
(Done) C: 2 hidden layers, 3 units in the first, 2 units in the second, bipolar representation (-1,1) and bipolar sigmoid activation function

For all, plot error as a function of the number of iterations.
