    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to find the \"strongest Pokemon\" and to see whether or not Pokemon have become stronger over time. It begins by loosely defining the \"strongest Pokemon\" as those with the highest Base Stat Totals (BST). The data set used contains information on over 1000 Pokemon (including alternate forms) from generations 1-8. This information includes base stats, BST, experience yield, egg cycle, types, generation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial definition of high BST is then worked with to find groups of pokemon on which to focus: strongest types, top 10% of BST, with/without legendary Pokemon, with/without fully-evolved pokemon. In general, every group provides the same answer to \"Who are the strongest Pokemon?\". Dragons outrank other Pokemon consistently. Additionally, the data shows that Pokemon have become stronger over time in nearly all stats, not just BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will begin by investigating the correlations between the numeric values of the data set. It then looks at the relationships between types and BSTs, the top three types by BST (dragon, steel, pyschic), the top 10% of Pokemon by BST, and the generational trends of Pokemon stats. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the strength of the \"strongest Pokemon\" definition and aspects of Pokemon to consider beyond just the BST."

    "### Data\n",
    "The data set used for this analysis (Appendix A) contains information on all 1074 Pokemon (this number is including alternate forms) from generations 1-8 of the Pokemon games with 47 initial attributes for each Pokemon. From these 47, the only ones used in the analysis are alternate form name, height, weight, primary and secondary type, games of origin, all six stats (health, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed), BST, all six EV yields and the EV yield total, catch rate, experience growth total, and experience yield. Moreover, two additional attributes are created and used: fully-evolved (a boolean denoting whether or not the pokemon is fully-evolved) and generation (an integer denoting the generation from which the pokemon originates). Note that fully-evolved means that the Pokemon evolves no further, so single-stage Pokemon are counted as fully-evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "The methods used for this analysis are simple and straightforward. A pearson correlation measure is used to look at the strength of the relationships between all numeric attributes of the data. Multiple summary statistics are used to evaluate the data, including mean, median, max, min, and interquartile range. \n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "#### Correlation\n",
    "Using the Pearson correlation, a matrix was constructed containing the correlation values between each numeric attribute of the data. A few of these were discarded outright: correlation between each attribute and itself and the correlations between the several \"id numbers\" (X, pokemon.id, pokedex.number, and generation). Additionally, correlations involving EV values were discarded since EVs only take values from 1-3 and strong correlations here are meaningless for the goal of this analysis. Finally, any remaining values less than 0.6 (and greater than -0.6) were discarded. This value was chosen to cut off attributes without significant relationships to help focus the analysis on strongly related attributes. The following pairs of attributes remained:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Health.Stat and Base.Stat.Total</li>\n",
    "    <li>Health.Stat and Experience.Yield</li>\n",
    "    <li>Attack.Stat and Base.Stat.Total</li>\n",
    "    <li>Attack.Stat and Experience.Yield</li>\n",

    "</ul>\n",

    "The following pairs will have their graphs included and discussed here: Attack and BST, Catch Rate and BST, Experience Yield and BST, and Experience Yield and Catch Rate.\n",

    "##### Attack and BST\n",
    "<img align=\"left\" src=\"AttackAndBST.png\" width=500 height=500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The high correlation between the Attack and BST makes sense. BST is a total of all the stats, so Pokemon with high stats will have high BSTs. Similarly, Pokemon with high BSTs likely have a high stat (or multiple high stats). Health, Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense also exhibit this same high correlation with BST. These pairs are included because notably Speed does not have a high correlation with BST.This seems to suggest that speed is unimportant when it comes to deciding whether a Pokemon is strong or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Attack was chosen as the representative since it had the highest correlation. This will be relevant during the Types discussion below."

A high catch rate means the Pokemon is easier to catch. A low catch rate means the Pokemon is harder to catch. This negative correlation makes sense since stronger Pokemon would be harder to catch. Notably, there exist a few outliers with a catch rate of 255 due to the presence of specific in-game events where those Pokemon are intentionally easy to capture."

Higher experience yield indicates a higher amount of experience points. This is the highest correlation value of all the data (disregarding the values between attributes and themselves). This strong correlation makes sense because stronger Pokemon will give more experience. A handful of outliers exist due to spcial Pokemon like Audino, Chansey, and Blissey who were intentionally given very large experience yields.\n",
