The client wants to determine the best/worst pokemon in general. A sound definition will be needed for best/wsorst. The top priority is to have many different supporting statistics for any conclusions reached. 

Potential Methodologies
    Regression analysis - determine correlations between various characteristics of the pokemon
    
    
Data available
    "C:\Users\kgtrm\Documents\R projects data\archive pokemon.zip"
    Will this data be enough? It should very likely be updated. Document this process.
    found base stats in source information on bulbapedia. parsed the file to create a df 
        using more information from bulbapedia, creating dataframes with each data piece needed, then joing them on name, ignoring all alternate forms
        then I found a better dataset and added the last bit of data I want (fully evolved, generation of origin)
