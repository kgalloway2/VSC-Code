The client wants to determine the best/worst pokemon in general. A sound definition will be needed for best/wsorst. The top priority is to have many different supporting statistics for any conclusions reached. 

Potential Methodologies
    Regression analysis - determine correlations between various characteristics of the pokemon
    
    
Defining best/worst as strongest.weakest by BST (base stat total)
    
Data available
    "C:\Users\kgtrm\Documents\R projects data\archive pokemon.zip"
    Will this data be enough? It should very likely be updated. Document this process.
    found base stats in source information on bulbapedia. parsed the file to create a df 
        using more information from bulbapedia, creating dataframes with each data piece needed, then joing them on name, ignoring all alternate forms
        then I found a better dataset and added the last bit of data I want (fully evolved, generation of origin)
        
        
Correlation Invesigations
    with the data cleaned, I looked for strong corrlations between any of the numeric characteristics, focusing on all pokemon and fully-evolved pokemon
    results are in the correlations investigations file (nothing too notable or against expectations)
    
Strongest types
    dragon outranked everything always haha looked at evolved and not, legendary and not, number of types, comparing all against BST
    psychic and steel were 2nd and 3rd
    
Just straight BSTs
    top 10% was mostly legendaries, psuedo-legendaries, megas, and a coupl eother alt forms, heavily dragon and psychic 

Look into top three types

strength by generation (with and without legendaries)
