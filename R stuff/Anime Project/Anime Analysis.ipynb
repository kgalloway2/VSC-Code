    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The original purpose of this analysis was to determine factors which contribute to the popularity of anime. However, the only easily accessible data did not contain enough attributes to perform any in-depth analysis. Thus, this report only contains a few conclusions about the trends of anime popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report asks and answers the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Does the release month of an anime affect its rating? (No)</li>\n",
    "    <li> Do the number of episodes affect an anime's rating? (No)</li>\n",
    "    <li> Has the quality (based on rating) of anime changed over the years? (Yes) If so, how? (It has increased)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this report will discuss the data, methods of analysis, and results of analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Body\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis contained 10000 different anime with the attributes of start date, end date, number of episode, rating, and anime type. Although there were 10000 data points, there were not enough attributes to perform more fruitful analysis than those discussed below. Moreover, there is a lot of data missing due to the fact that a few of the anime are still running at the time of this analysis, so the data is missing their end date and number of episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of attributes among the data, the analyses performed were very simple: graphs of attributes were inspected to identify trends and notable characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Release Month vs Anime Rating\n",
    "<img src=\"ReleaseMonthVSRating.png\" width=1000 height=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The only notable finding here is the high ratings among MOvies and TV during the specific months. For TV anime, January, April, July, and October see higher ratings than every other month. However, this is primarly due to the release schedule of televised anime. Those four months are the months when new anime are released most often. As a result, these months will see more anime which are highly rated. For anime movies, February, April, August, and Spetember enjoy higher ratings. However, these months are also months when movies are more popular anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no notable conclusions for the other anime types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of Episodes vs Rating\n",
    "<img src=\"NumberEpisodesVSRating.png\" width=600 height=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The data here seems to suggest a relationship between number of episodes and anime rating: more episodes leads to a lower rating. However, this data is not very useful since the vast majority of anime have about 12 or 24 episodes, while very few anime run for 30 - 200 episodes, and an incredibly small amount run for more than 200 episodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Release Year vs Mean Rating\n",
    "<img src=\"YearsVSRating.png\" width=800 height=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when looking at the relationship between Release Year and Mean Rating, the data seems to suggest a relationship for each type of anime. The ratings of anime appear to be trending upward in each type! That is, over the years, anime have gotten higher ratings on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, similar to the conclusions with release month, it should be noted that significantly more anime have been released over the past 15-20 years. More anime could lead to higher average ratings since people watching and rating will not be able to see everything. Therfore, they would focus their attention only on anime receiving praise and high ratings. So, good anime gets inflated ratings, while bad and mediocre anime just get ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth nothing that both TV anime and anime Specials appear to have declining ratings over the past few years. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion(s)/Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis produced the following findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> The release month of anime does not appear to have an effect on its rating. However, anime released in accordance with the release schedule (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) tend to have higher ratings on average than anime released in other months.</li>\n",
    "    <li> The number of episodes does not appear to have an effect on on its rating. The amount of data for anime with large numbers of episodes is not comparable to those with about 12 or 24 episodes, so no conclusions can be reached.</li>\n",
    "    <li> The quality (based on rating) of anime seems to have increased over the years for each type of anime. As discussed above, this could be due to the large amount of anime products released over the past couple of decades.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Areas of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis should definitely be redone with better data. The data did not contain enough attributes to provide for varied analysis. Additionally, much of the data was incomplete since many TV anime are still running. \n",
