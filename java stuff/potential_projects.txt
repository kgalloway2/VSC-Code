1. Automatic Timetable generation
Java Project Idea: This project can be built to reduce manual work and extra time to create timetables in educational institutions. 
The timetable has to be generated in such a way that all the subjects are covered within the given time slots with the respective 
faculties and timings also must not overlap. This system automatically generates the scheduled timetable for faculties and students. 
There is an admin page. The admin can be either any faculty of the college or any other authorized employee.

After login, the admin can add faculty, subjects. In faculty details, he will give inputs like name, email id, and mobile number. 
Then, while adding subjects, he will enter the subject name, year, faculty name. Then after adding the required subjects and faculties, 
the admin can generate the timetable of a particular year and view it.

The project displays the node connectivity in networking in data visualization form. This node connectivity can be located at 
different locations via mouse or trackpad. The project has the following goals & objectives:

 - Effective and Clear Communication of information using graphical & pictorial means.
 - It should have both functionality and Aesthetic.
 - It should convey ideas effectively & provide necessary insights into complex sets of data & information.

Data Visualization software makes it easier for the user to understand & grasp the information when they are displayed or 
represented as charts or graphs rather than report pages.
